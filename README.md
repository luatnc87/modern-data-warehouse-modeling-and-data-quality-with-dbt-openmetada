# Modern data warehouse modeling and ensuring data quality with dbt and OpenMetadata

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to effective data modeling and robust data quality assurance using popular open-source tools such as dbt and OpenMetadata. Dive into practical examples and best practices to elevate your data analytics projects.

# Understanding the Tools
In this session, we'll familiarize ourselves with the key tools that power our data modeling and data quality journey: dbt and OpenMetadata. 
## dbt
dbt, which stands for Data Build Tool, is a command-line tool that revolutionizes the way data transformations and modeling are done. Here's a deeper dive into dbt's capabilities:
- **Modular Data Transformations**: dbt uses SQL and YAML files to define data transformations and models. This modular approach allows you to break down complex transformations into smaller, more manageable pieces, enhancing mantainability and version control.
- **Data Testing**: dbt facilitates data testing by allowing you to define expectations about your data. It helps ensure data quality by automatically running tests against your transformed data.
- **Version Control**: dbt projects can be version controlled with tools like Git, enabling collaboration among data professionals while keeping a history of changes.
- **Incremental Builds**: dbt supports incremental builds, meaning it only processes data that has changed since the last run. This feature saves time and resources when working with large datasets.
- **Orchestration**: While dbt focuses on data transformations and modeling, it can be integrated with orchestration tools like Apache Airflow or dbt Cloud to create automated data pipelines.

## OpenMetadata
OpenMatadata is a powerful open-source metadata management platform designed to streamline metadata management processes and enhance data governance. it offers a range of key features that are essential for maintaining data quality and ensuring effective data management within your analytics projects:
- **Metadata Catalog**: OpenMetadata provides a centralized catalog for storing and managing metadata related to your data assets, including tables, databases, reports, and more. This catalog makes it easy to discover and access critical information about your data.
- **Data Linage**: Understanding data lineage is crucial for tracking the flow of data through your systems. OpenMetadata offers robust data lineage tracking, allowing you to visualize how data moves from source to destination, which is essential for ensuring data quality and accuracy.
- **Data Documentation**: Comprehensive data documentation is essential for effective data governance. OpenMetadata enables you to document your data assets. This collaborative approach enhances communication and knowledge sharing wihthin your organization. 
- **Version Control**: Version control is critical for tracking changes to metadata over time. OpenMetadata offers versioning capabilities, ensuring that you can viuew and revert to previous version of metadata when you needed.
- **API Integration**: OpenMetadata can be integrated with other tools and platforms in your data stack, enabling seamless data governance and metadata management across your entire data ecosystem.
- **Custom Metadata Types**: OpenMetadata allows you to define custom metadata types tailored to your organization's specific needs. This flexibility ensures that you can capture and manage metadata that is relevant to your unique data assets.
- **Search and Discovery**: OpenMetadata offers advanced search and discovery capabilities, making it easy to find the data assets you need quickly. Users can search based on metadata attributes, tags, and other criteria.
- **Data Quality Monitoring**: OpenMetadata can be used to track and monitor data quality by associating quality metrics and checks with data assets. This feature is vital for ensuring data accuracy and reliability.
- **Data Governance**: OpenMetadata supports data governance practices by providing access controls, audit trails, and compliance features. It helps organizations adhere to data governance policies and regulations.

These key features of OpenMetadata make it a valuable addition to your data management toolkit, particularly when combined with dbt for data modeling and transformation. Together, these tools empower data professionals to build well-structured, high-quality analytics projects while maintaining control and visibility over their data assets.
